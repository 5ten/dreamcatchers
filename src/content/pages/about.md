## Our Mission
Our mission at Dreamcatchers Empowerment Network is to provide assessments, job preparation, job placement and job coaching to youth and adults with limitations and disabilities. We are dedicated to serving individuals in a collaborative manner, with a network of other agencies. Dreamcatchers services are directed at assisting individuals to prepare for, choose, obtain, and retain employment. Services are tailored to an individual's strengths, resources, priorities, needs, abilities, interests and informed choices.

## Philosophy
The philosophy at Dreamcatchers Empowerment Network is a client-centered approach to providing services with respect and dignity, as well as educating the community on the benefits of employing people with limitations. We believe that when an individual achieves meaningful employment, the community benefits from the exposure and contributions of individuals, who are frequently marginalized. Dreamcatchers employment services are key to fighting stigma and discrimination for individuals with limitations.

We strive to create an environment that is participatory, goal-oriented, enjoyable, and holds trustworthiness and loyalty at the core of all we do.
