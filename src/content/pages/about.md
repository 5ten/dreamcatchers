## Our Mission
Our mission at Dreamcatchers Empowerment Network is to empower and provide hope to youth and adults with limitations and disabilities by providing assessments, job preparation, job placement and job coaching through informed choice and by collaborating and creating of community partnerships with other agencies.

## Philosophy
The philosophy at Dreamcatchers Empowerment Network is a client-centered approach to providing services with respect and dignity, as well as educating the community on the benefits of employing people with limitations. We believe that when an individual achieves meaningful employment, the community benefits from the exposure and contributions of individuals, who are frequently marginalized. Dreamcatchers employment services are key to fighting stigma and discrimination for individuals with limitations.

We strive to create an environment that is participatory, goal-oriented, enjoyable, and holds trustworthiness and loyalty at the core of all we do.
