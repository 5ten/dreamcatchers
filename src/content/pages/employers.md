  Dreamcatchers Empowerment Network can make that happen!  By hiring our
  clients, who have disabilities, will not only provide a benefit to your
  company and community, but will also change our clientsâ€™ lives in so many
  positive ways! Dreamcatchers fights the stigma and reduces the barriers to
  employment that many people with disabilities and limitations face in seeking
  employment. We educate businesses in our communities about the employment
  strengths and skills that our clients have to offer, as well as hiring
  incentives, such as tax credits and On-The-Job-Training funds.
