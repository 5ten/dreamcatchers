## Why Work with Dreamcatchers?
Dreamcatchers has been providing employment services for more than 15 years and  we are happy to answer any questions you might have and provide you with references. Our services are offered throughout Butte, Contra Costa, Placer, Sacramento, Solano and Yolo counties.

Dreamcatchers fights the stigma and reduces the barriers to employment that many people with disabilities and limitations face in seeking employment. We educate businesses in our communities about the employment strengths and skills that our clients have to offer, as well as hiring incentives, such as tax credits and On-The-Job-Training funds. 

## How we work
Dreamcatchers Empowerment Network is dedicated to serving individuals in a collaborative manner, with a network of other agencies. Dreamcatchers services are directed at assisting individuals to prepare for, choose, obtain, and retain employment. Services are tailored to an individual's strengths, resources, priorities, needs, abilities, interests and informed choices.

We assess our clients' employment strengths and weaknesses within a supportive and controlled environment; measure basic work skills, behaviors and interpersonal skills in a simulated environment; and provide specific training and tools in order make them employable in the competitive marketplace.

We work closely with several community-based organizations to provide consistent services. We value the relationships established by collaborating with other community partners to provide a continuum of wrap-around services to individuals needing support within the community. Building relationships with employers is a critical component to the success in achieving our outcomes. Not only do we support the clients with whom we are working, but we also provide support to employers to sustain those valuable relationships.  

Dreamcatchers is here to help you with your hiring needs and here is how we do it:

Depending upon the clients we have available, and your need for help, Dreamcatchers will pay our clients to work at intervals of up to 40 hours at your site; doing work you need done AT NO COST TO YOU.   Dreamcatchers covers all wages and insurance for our clients. Our Employment Specialists stay onsite during the work shifts  to ensure work safety, compliance, quality of work and to monitor progress.
