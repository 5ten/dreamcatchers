## A New Post

In 2015 I had been out of work for more than 2 years and found myself working at Ross to make ends meet. Not that Ross isn’t an okay place to work, but I was making minimum wage which back then was only $9 per hour. I had been a Sparkpoint client for a few months, attending an interview workshop led by Sylvia G. and had been using the WIB for classes such as resume building, etc., but not getting the callbacks I needed. One morning after being at Ross for a few months, Sylvia called to say an opening for an Admin person had come up at Dreamcatchers, which was her primary employer. I hesitated, can’t really say why, but told Sylvia that I was working at Ross. I will never forget her response, “Don’t you want a REAL job?” Those words changed my life.
 
I interviewed with Dreamcatchers and received a job offer a week later as Program Coordinator, which is a job I absolutely love and believe I was born to do! After almost seven years of employment, I can’t say enough about the wonderful people I get to work with and how rewarding it is to track our clients as they get jobs that change their lives as well. - Renee P.
