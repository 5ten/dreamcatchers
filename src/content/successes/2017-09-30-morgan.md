"My experience with Dreamcatchers was nothing but positive. My job coach was extremely knowledgeable and experienced in what she does. She was very supportive and was there to help me whenever I needed it. I learned a lot of very useful skills and in working with Dreamcatchers I felt very prepared and confident that I would gain employment. I would recommend their services to anyone looking to improve their resume, interview, and job related skills."
