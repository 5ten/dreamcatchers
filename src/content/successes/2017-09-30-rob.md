"I went through the Department of Rehab because I have a heart condition, and wasn't really sure if I'd ever be able to find a job, which led me to Dreamcatchers.  My fantastic counselor, Dyane, met with me once or twice a week to help me get back in to the working world.  She helped me put together my resume and gave me job leads all over Solano County, wherever I was willing to travel and then it was my job to actually apply.  Without their support, I might have just given up.  I have been gainfully employed for over a year now and appreciate everything that they have done for me."
